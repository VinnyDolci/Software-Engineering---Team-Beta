This project is an adaptation of everyone's favorite game to lose money at, Left-Right-Center!

We have taken the core components of LRC and added some new dice outcomes such as:
- Link: You and another player's fates are tied together. Until another player rolls this die.
- Give to all: You have to pay out 1 BetaBuck to every player in the game
- Golden Roll: You immediately get all of the BetaBucks that are in the pot
- And More!

This project is currently under devlopment and full functionality will not be available until the end of the Spring semester 2022.
